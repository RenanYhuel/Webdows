## 🖥️ How It Works

### 🏗️ Windows Management
Each application runs inside a draggable and resizable window, mimicking a real OS environment. 

### 🖥️ Desktop Interaction
The desktop acts as the main workspace where windows can be moved and managed dynamically.

### 📌 Taskbar
A taskbar is included to keep track of open applications and provide easy switching between them.

### 📂 Adding a New Application
To add a new application:
1. Create a new folder inside `src/apps/`.
2. Develop your component following the existing structure.
3. Register it inside `Desktop.tsx` for it to appear.

## 🔥 The Biggest Challenge

Recreating an OS-like environment in the web browser is no small feat. Managing window states, taskbar interactions, and dynamic application loading has been an exciting technical challenge. But with determination, anything is possible! 💪
